# dispatch-sys

Direct FFI bindings to Apple's Dispatch Clang module.

The Clang module definition can be found in the iOS and macOS SDKs included with Xcode at
`$SDKROOT/usr/include/dispatch/module.modulemap`. These FFI bindings are derived from
[libdispatch-1462.0.4](https://github.com/apple-oss-distributions/libdispatch/tree/libdispatch-1462.0.4).
