//! Apple defines types compatible with the polymorphic Core Foundation functions outside of the
//! Core Foundation framework (e.g., `CoreGraphics`, `CoreText`). The facilities this crate uses to
//! provide idiomatic Rust API bindings for Core Foundation are available to crates implementing
//! Rust API bindings for frameworks with Core Foundation-compatible types.
//!
//! [`ForeignFunctionInterface`] is the primary trait used to bridge the between the foreign
//! function interface and Rust. It provides a facility to retrieve the [`CFTypeRef`] pointer from
//! the Rust type for use in calling foreign functions. This trait **should not** be used by crates
//! utilizing the Rust API bindings; it's intended only for crates *implementing* Rust API bindings.
//! This is intentionally separate from [`Object`] so the FFI related functionality is not visible
//! by default when using the [`Object`] interface.
